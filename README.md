# Employee Directory challenge
Welcome to this above challenge! This is the server side of the project.

I primarily used Express.JS, Node.JS, and created a back end that connects to mongoDB.

The prompt noted that I could just make a JSON file to add and subtract users to, 
but I thought I'd got the extra mile and add a complete back end application.

# Express functions

I created a get, create, edit, and delete function so this directory could allow users to update the employee directory.

# What I'd like to have.

My edit funtion is a bit buggy. I had it working for a minute, but something went wrong on deployment! My bad!
I'd also like to use a website like cloudinary to upload custom photos so the edit and create functions are a bit ore versitile.

# Where I got the data from

As requested, I pulled data from https://randomuser.me
